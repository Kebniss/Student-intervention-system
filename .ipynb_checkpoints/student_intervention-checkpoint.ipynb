    "**Random Forests:** Random Forests are an ensemble learning method, they combine the predictions of different learning models in order in order to improve generalizability and robustness over a single estimator. In particular they fit a user specified number of tree classifiers on different subsets of the training data. It then use average to improve accuracy and control over-fitting. This procedure improve model performance because it decreases the variance of the model with little or no increase to the bias. The size of the sub-samples is the same of the original input, what changes are the features that are taken into account: at each split a different subset of features is picked up by the algorithm and one of them is selected. The split is then performed on that feature. This procedure is done in order to limit the development of correlation among different trees: this would likely happen as usually there are few features that are strong predictors and all the trees would end up doing the same split on those.\n",
    "Despite usually having to train a large number of trees RF are very fast to train as the fitting alghorithm can be easily parallelized by having one tree being trained on independent hardware.\n",
    "Thanks to this property RF run well on large datasets.\n",
    "RF as well as trees are non-parametric which means that both models make no assumption on the distribution of the data. This property gives the RF the ability to describe many more distributions than other models: linear and kernel regression, for example, are limited in descrybing distributions that fit well with the function that has been chosen as core. \n",
    "Another advantage of using RF is that, thanks to the entropy analisys, it estimates which variables are important by preferring splitting data according to those features that generates more knowledge.\n",
    "The main con is that classifications made by RFs are too complicated to be interpreted by humans(not true for a single tree). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case given that data are few and have a lot of features I figured that RF would perform well as they are able to determine which features have a stronger prediction power and they immediately perform split on those. Also, given the possibility to parallelize the tasks I expect them to be quick in training which will be one of the things that I'll need to take into account when making a decision on the classifier. Lastly they are not parametric which is good since I have no idea how a figure in 48 dimesion look like. I specified the depth to 8 as I figured that 2^8 = 256 is a sufficient number of leaves to obtain a good characterization of the data without overfitting. I also specified the size of the forest to 128 trees as this paper argue (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230766603_How_Many_Trees_in_a_Random_Forest) should be enough to reduce the variance of the model as much as possible.\n",

Metrics different from the Euclidean can be defined for specific data, like categorical.  Because it takes into account numerous instances in order to predict a value or a class this algorith is robust against noisy training data. \n",
    "Training of KNN is very fast as it simply consists in storing the training data, predicting, on the other hand, is computationally expensive because it needs to calculate retrieve the K closest instances and calculate their mean, in case of continous data, or have them vote for the class to predict. \n",

    "**SVM with RBF Kernel:** SVMs are a class of methods that learn by determining and maximizing the separation margin among two classes. The power of SVMs is that through the definition of different kernel functions they are able to describe data with different distributions: from the simplest linearly separable to others more complicated (polynomially separable, rbf...). Basically what we are doing by specifying a non linear kernel is to transform the data in a higher dimensional space where they are linearly separable, maximize the linear margin and then trasform it back to the original space obtaining the nonlienar margin outline. SVMs are parametric methods because of the strong assumptions that are made on data distribution and the goal of learning parameters that describe a separation function.   \n",
    "Although they can be computationally heavy during fitting (training time is cubicly proportional to the number of data) they are extremely fast in testing as the result of the training are a subset of support vectors that refer to those points that most influence the margin.\n",
    "SVMs perform extremely well in cases where data can be sharply separated, independently from the type of space where this is true (as long as we can define a Kernel that describes the similarity of the data). They also perform well in high dimensional spaces, even those where the number of dimensions is higher than those of the data. However performance drops when the classes tend to overlap and when the number of features is greater than those of samples.  \n",

    "**Random forest:** Given the experiments performed earlier Random Forests (RF) with 128 trees perform well in classifying the data with an F1 score consistently greater than 0.82, (0.8 is the result for a model that predicts all passes, our baseline). However performance time both in fitting and prediction is in the order of tenth of seconds, two orders of magnitude greater than the other two classifiers I chose. When I tried to run the fitting in parallel the performance time increased of 0.15s on average: I think that it is caused by the initialization of the data on different cores. Most likely with these little data this action is not worth the effort. Despite the good performance the time needed to train and predict is considerably larger than the other two models, thus I don't think it is the best model for this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**K-Nearest Neighbor:** As expected KNN is faster in training than both RT and SVC while in testing is comparable with SVCs. Score performance is good, around 0.81, but is still lower than SVC score. Overall I think that this model might only worth to be considered only if we had many more data, and only if the cost of training them was really high and higher than the storage cost. And even in this case I feel that it might not be worth to choose KNN as training is something that is normally done once (unless data change continously) while prediction is done more often. It might be the case that you still prefer a model that takes longer to train but is more precise and comparably fast in predicting rather than one fast in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SVC with RBF Kernel:** The performance time of this model is comparable with KNN, although slightly slower in training, moreover its F1 score is the highest among the three. Normally these models don't perform well because they have a running time that scales quadratically with the number of instances to train. In this case however the dataser is small and this ends up not being an issue. Thus, I think that for this problem SVM with RBF kernel is the best model to use. \n",

    "**SVMs Layman explanation:**\n",
    "An instance of a set of data when plotted is a point in a space that has as many dimensions as the features of data. Classification aims to find rules to tell which characteristics make a point belong to one class or another. SVMs represent a classification method that wants to determine the linear boundary (best margin) that best divides the data. Said line (or plane) is the one that is the most distant from the nearest points belonging to the two classes. Those points that influence the margin are called support vectors. In the below image there is a graphical representation of linear separable data, those points that act as support vectors and the best margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "![linear svm](SVM_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes however it is not possible to draw a line that separates the data because of how the features constraints them. The solution in these cases is to project(draw them with a new set of coordinates depending on the original ones) the points into a different space where features assume simpler values and thus can be divided with a plane. This process is extremely clear in the below image: as shown on the right data cannot be separated by a line in a two dimensional space, however by projecting them on a three dimentional space (left) they are now easily separable by a plane. This is called the kernel trick and can be applied to a lot of different space transformations. Another neat property of data projection is that once the margin has been identified it is possible to invert the transformation and now the margin separating the two classes will be a non linear one but will still separate the data correctly. Again, in the figure on the right the green ring is the plane (the margin on the left) projected in a lower dimentional space.\n",
